        // might stop earlier (count will be less than 5, and the following IF will not execute), or it will continue until 5 and stop.
        // In this case, !=0 might still be true, meaning that the loop terminated
        //because of count but the number had not actually become 0, which then must mean it had more than 6 digits.
        // We test for this case in the IF condition after the loop. In the end, the use of count is two-fold: making sure
